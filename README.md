# Mojette-Sharding-Cypher
A Mojette transform lets you create a truly Presonal, Secure, Encryption system! You have a Cypher that require 3 Key stored in different locations to fully Decrypt the data store: 1. On the Users' machine, 2. On the Network, through Blockchain addresses &amp; replication, 3. A Biometric Authentication "fingerprints" of the Person, stored in a TPM or secure hardware network! 4.th (optional) can be user passwords and PINs. This has the property that Decrypt the data, you need the user's Current Active device which is the only process which can securely authenticate. A formerly used device which had the user's data &amp; passwords on it and access to their network wallet  (1, 2 &amp; 4) is NOT enough!  Once a user creates a Vault, their Network accessible keys are split into shards and distributed among secure nodes on the blockchain. Only be recombining all 3. or 4 sources of Key Shards can a user's UniKey Vault be opened! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojette_Transform
